Comments:
The structure of this project was largely inspired by the Mozilla express
tutorial.
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website)

Many of the GUI elements and stylings were adapted from the chat.io
project by Omar El Gabry. (https://github.com/OmarElGabry/chat.io)

The comments are mainly for my own benefit so feel free to overlook them, this
is one of the larger, more structured projects of this nature that I have done
so I have used the comments mostly for my own reference.
